                Making the transition to raw food is easier than you might think. We recommend making the switch by
                just stopping feeding kibble, and the next day start feeding raw.

                      Start with the most cost effective protein, which is <Link>Chicken</Link>, then once or
                      twice a week switch to a different protein. <Link>Turkey,</Link>&nbsp;
                      <Link class="text-white">Duck</Link> and <Link>Rabbit</Link> are
                      also great choices as they are often easy to digest as well.

                    <p>
                      Serve the first few meals at room temperature rather than cold, and offer
                      a half serving first. Wait a bit before providing the remaining serving. This
                      will help prevent your pet from eating too fast and vomiting.

              Raw Diet Feeding Guidelines
            </h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
              The following recommendations are guidelines
              only based on an average dog of normal weight
              and activity. Your breeder may recommend a
              feeding schedule.

              2% of their body weight or 1lb for every 50lbs of
              the dog. We like to feed twice daily, and
              recognize this doesnâ€™t work for all families, so
              feeding once a day is ok as well.
