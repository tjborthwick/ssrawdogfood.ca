                  Why We Do What We Do
                </h2>

                <p class=" mb-4">
                  Our puppy had allergies when we brought him home,
                  though at first we weren't sure what was going on. We did
                  the normal things; changed food, went to the vet, and after
                  doing our own research we decided to try raw. Best thing we
                  ever did, as our puppyâ€™s issues cleared up.
                </p>

                <p class=" mb-4">
                  We found buying raw food a little pricey but wanted a
                  healthy happy dog, so we decided to try making our own.
                  From there the rest is history. We thought why not do this
                  for other people? Today we provide a quality product at a
                  good price, making it easier for everyone to feed their dog a
                  raw diet.
                </p>
