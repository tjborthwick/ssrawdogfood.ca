                Why We Do What We Do
              </h2>

              <p class="text-white mb-4">
                Our puppy had allergies when we brought him home,
                though at first we weren't sure what was going on. We did
                the normal things; changed food, went to the vet, and after
                doing our own research we decided to try raw. Best thing we
                ever did, as our puppyâ€™s issues cleared up.
              </p>

              <p class="text-white mb-4">
                We found buying raw food a little pricey but wanted a
                healthy happy dog, so we decided to try making our own.
                From there the rest is history. We thought why not do this
                for other people? Today we provide a quality product at a
                good price, making it easier for everyone to feed their dog a
                raw diet.
